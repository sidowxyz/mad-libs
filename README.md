# Story Generator

This is a simple Python program that generates a story based on the user's input. The user is prompted to enter five words: an adjective, a noun, a verb, another noun, and another verb. The program then uses these words to generate a story.

## How to use

1. Save the code as a Python file.
2. Run the program from the command line.
3. The program will prompt you to enter the five words.
4. The program will then print the story.

## Example


python story.py
```

```
Enter an adjective: happy
Enter a noun: cat
Enter a verb: napping
Enter another noun: dog
Enter another verb: playing

Once upon a time, there was a happy cat who loved to nap all day.

One day, a dog walked into the room and caught the cat in the act.

The dog: "What are you doing?"
The cat: "I'm just napping, what's the big deal?"
The dog: "Well, it's not every day that you see a cat napping in the middle of the day."
The cat: "I guess you're right. Maybe I should take a break."
The dog: "That's probably a good idea. Why don't we go playing instead?"
The cat: "Sure, that sounds like fun!"

And so, the cat and the dog went off to playing and had a great time.
